# Mini-Shop-Front-End
Mini Online Shop Front End, only HTML5 and CSS3, without Back End
Simple, primitive, rough design. not finished yet. Just to understand in which direction the page should go. No user interaction. (for now) 
but can be done with pleasure, e.g. small smooth menu with relatively links or so idk. A gallery, with photos of cars and information that you can call up etc
